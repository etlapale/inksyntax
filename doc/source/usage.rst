You must first select a language for the code fragment. Starting to
type a language name in the text entry will display a popup with all
matching names. The part between parentheses indicates which
highlighter backend is used (pygments_ or highlight_). The *Ok* button
is disabled, and the text entry shows a warning icon, until you select
a valid language name.

When an existing highlighted code fragment is selected before
launching the extension, its content will be used as a starting point.
